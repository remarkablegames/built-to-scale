    angel "I'm here to guide you as you start this exciting journey.{w=0.5} Every successful entrepreneur needs more than just business acumen – you'll need to focus on three key areas: Intelligence,{w=0.5} Stamina,{w=0.5} and Charisma."

    angel "But remember, every action you take will consume your energy and time. The day will end when you either run out of energy or it's too late to keep working. Make sure to balance your tasks wisely!"
