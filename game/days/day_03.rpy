    competitor smirk "Oh, I’m sorry. How rude of me. I'm Ava. You can consider me your competitor. I run a real business in this town. Scales, you say? Cute. But don’t get too comfortable."

    player "What do you mean by that?"

    competitor "I mean, it’s only a matter of time before your little operation folds. You see, I have the resources, the connections, and, well... the brains. What do you have? Hope?"

    player "I have determination. That’s more than enough."

    competitor laugh "Ha! Determination? Adorable. Here’s a tip for you: Stay out of my way, and maybe you won’t get crushed. This town isn’t big enough for two scale businesses, and I don’t like to share."

    player "I’m not backing down."

    competitor "Good. I like a challenge. Just don’t say I didn’t warn you when your precious little dream comes crumbling down. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have a real company to run."
